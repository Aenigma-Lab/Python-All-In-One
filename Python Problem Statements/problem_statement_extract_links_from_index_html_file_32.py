# extract links from index.html file 

# very easy  solution but not the best  ğŸ˜’ğŸ˜’ğŸ˜’ğŸ˜’

# the problem in this solution is it will extract only 1 line in a line
# if have multiple link in line then it will fail to extract 2nd links in same line.

# with open('index.html','r') as webpage:
#     with open('urls.txt', 'a') as tf:
#         for line in webpage.readlines():
#             if "<a href=" in line:
#                 url_line = line.find("<a href=")
#                 url_start_quote = line.find('\"',url_line)
#                 url_end_quote = line.find('\"',url_start_quote+1)

#                 urls = line[url_start_quote+1:url_end_quote]
