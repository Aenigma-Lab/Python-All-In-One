# Here we will see what diffrece between list and array in python.
# LIST vs ARRAY.............

# Array----> ordered collection of items
# List------> In python ordered collection of items.

# In  c c++ and java programming languages we can store single type of datatype.

# But in python list we can store any type of data types. It is flexible


#In python There is "Array module" where we can store single type of datatype. but the performace of array module is faster then list.


##############  WHY WE DONT USE ARRAY MODULE IN PYTON?
# Arrays module is not used in normal ptython because it is not flexible like list. but it is used in "numpy arry". becuse "numpy" array binding with "c" program. and c program is very fast.


# we can bind the python progam with c to faster executable, and it will flexible becuse it written in python.
