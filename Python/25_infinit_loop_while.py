#infinite loop
# this loop create due to coading error.
i = 0
while i <= 10:
  print("hello world") #here i = 0 so condition will always be true so infine loop will  run till end of universe.


# if we write infine loop with known reasons then we write the loop with like this.

while True:
  print("Hello World.....")
